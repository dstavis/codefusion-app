http://codefusion.io enter "demo" on the homepage to see how it works!

codefusion is a tool that allows programmers to broadcast local files and folders to the web as they are being changed. It was designed to allow teachers to share code examples with students in real time. Students can view the code on our website, take notes on each file, and save the directories to study later. Thanks to codefusion, students can stop worrying about capturing syntax and focus on learning.

We use a Ruby Gem to track changes on the teacher's machine, send them to Firebase, and display the files and directories on our Ember.js front-end.
